//! Asking Google the study's own question, from where a searcher would stand.
//!
//! The inventory sweep restricts to a rectangle, which no searcher stands in — so it says nothing
//! about how far a customer will look. The probe biases a circle around a node instead, and that is
//! the only observation that identifies the distance coefficient.
//!
//! The mask is `places.id,nextPageToken`: both are Text Search Essentials (IDs only), which the
//! free monthly allowance covers. Every attribute joins by id from the inventory already fetched.
