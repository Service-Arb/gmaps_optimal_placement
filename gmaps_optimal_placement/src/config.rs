//! The study document. Not settings: there is no sane environment-variable spelling of `[[layer]]`,
//! so it is plain `Deserialize` from a path, with a JSON schema for the editor.
//!
//! A study is not one file. It is a trade applied to a location — `import trades/cleaning.nix
//! (import locations/Lyon.nix)` — because the two vary independently. What the location decides is
//! the frame, the statistics office behind it, and the addresses being considered; everything else
//! is the trade. Nothing here may need both: see the invariant in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
//!
//! A location on its own is also a study — `import locations/Lyon.nix`, the identity of the pairing
//! — and the three fields below that a trade fills are `None` for it. What is left is what the
//! statistical archive publishes, which is the whole of the free half: a city can be looked at
//! before a single Places call is spent on it.
